This has the exact same API as
[WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket). So
you get going with:

```
ReconnectingWebSocket = require(reconnecting-websocket)
ws = new ReconnectingWebSocket('ws://...');
```

#Events
##ws
A reference to the contained WebSocket in case you need to poke under the hood.

    background = window?.requestAnimationFrame or setTimeout

    module.exports = (WebSocket) ->

      class ReconnectingWebSocket
        constructor: (@url) ->
          @couldBeBusted = true
          @forceclose = false
          @allowReconnect = false
          @wasConnected = false
          @connect()
          @reconnect()

This is the connection retry system. Keep trying at every opportunity.

        reconnect: () ->
          background =>
            if not @forceclose
              @reconnect()
              if @readyState isnt WebSocket.OPEN
                if Date.now() > @reconnectAfter
                  @connect()

The all powerful connect function, sets up events and error handling.

        connect: () ->
          @reconnectAfter = Date.now() + 200
          @readyState = WebSocket.CONNECTING
          @ws = new WebSocket(@url)
          @ws.onopen  = (event) =>
            @wasConnected = true
            @readyState = WebSocket.OPEN
            @reconnectAfter = Date.now() * 2
            @onopen(event)
          @ws.onclose = (event) =>
            if @wasConnected
              @ondisconnect(new Event('disconnected', {data: {forceClose: @forceclose}}))
            @reconnectAfter = 0
            if @forceclose
              @readyState = WebSocket.CLOSED
              @onclose(event)
            else
              @readyState = WebSocket.CONNECTING
          @ws.onmessage = (event) =>
            @onmessage(event)
          @ws.onerror = (event) =>
            @reconnectAfter = 0
            @onerror(event)

Sending has an odd uncatchable exception, so use marker flags
to know that we did or did not get past a send.

        send: (data) ->
          state = @readyState
          @readyState = WebSocket.CLOSING
          if typeof(data) is "object"
            @ws.send(JSON.stringify(data))
          else
            @ws.send(data)
          @readyState = state

        close: ->
          @forceclose = true
          @ws.close()

Since there's all sorts of ways your connection can be severed if it's not active
( e.g. nginx ), we'll allow you to specify a keep alive message and an interval
on which to send it.
    
        keepAlive: (timeoutMs, message) ->
          sendMessage = () => @send(message)
          setInterval(sendMessage, timeoutMs)

Empty shims for the event handlers. These are just here for discovery via
the debugger.

        onopen: (event) ->
        onclose: (event) ->
        onmessage: (event) ->
        onerror: (event) ->

As a convenience for testing, we'll emit a message when we've disconnected.

        ondisconnect: (event) ->
